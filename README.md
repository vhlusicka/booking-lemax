Welcome to automated Cypress tests for Booking.com I made as a part of task for Lemax selection process for QA.
I implemented two test cases: BKNG01-01-03 and BKNG01-01-10. Both of them are also present in test plan excel file.

In order to run the tests do the following steps (using Visual Studio code or any other IDE):

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/vhlusicka/booking-lemax.git


2. Run the Cypress:

    npx cypress open


3. Click on any of two test cases when Cypress UI opens up: BKNG01-01-03 and BKNG01-01-10
